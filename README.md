# Known Issues:

- When picking up items such as when mining blocks while building, and said blocks are in offhand, they get stacked into inventory instead of offhand, eventually forcing you to manually replace the stack into offhand. To avoid this, try to keep blocks in hotbar instead.

- Slot is partially on top of / covered by crafting menu if it's scrolled down. Just change position in config if this bothers you enough.

# Planned Features:

- Changing offhand slot texture

- Adding a clickable toggle to the offhand slot, which decides whether holding the 'Use Offhand Slot' key will use the item's normal attack(LMB), or it's alternate attack(RMB)
