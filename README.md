# Known Issues:

- When picking up items such as when mining blocks while building, and said blocks are in offhand, they get stacked into inventory instead of offhand, eventually forcing you to manually replace the stack into offhand. To avoid this, try to keep blocks in hotbar instead.

- Slot is partially on top of / covered by crafting menu if it's scrolled down. 

# Planned Features:

- Changing offhand slot texture

- Adding a toggle that allows dragging the offhand slot

- Adding a clickable toggle to the offhand slot, which decides whether holding the 'Use Offhand Slot' key will use the item's normal attack(LMB), or it's alternate attack(RMB)
- (DONE) ~~Making offhand slot visible even when inventory is closed~~ (DONE)

- Allowing use of 2 items simultaneously, like shooting a bow and swinging a sword together. May require rewriting half of the mod and adding a lot of new code.

- Adding a check to disable 'Use Offhand Item' keybind if it is set to mouse2(RMB) and the player is currently holding a dual-function(LMB/RMB) item in their selected hotbar slot.

- (DONE) ~~Adding a check where if user has 'Use Offhand Item' keybind set to mouse2(RMB), the mod will see if you are hovering over an interactable(like a chest) and allow the game to take precedence for right clicks, so that the interaction goes through without setting off your 'Use Offhand Item' keybind.~~ (DONE)
