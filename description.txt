Put an item in the custom slot below inventory, and when you use your custom keybind (Default RMB), it will use the item in that slot. 
Only allows using one at a time, no doubling your dps! Summoners, you can still whipstack lightning fast with this ;)

Multiplayer is now working. Everything should work fine, but please report any error codes if you somehow get any in chat. ("Code (XXX): please conta...")

Configurable keybinds! (you MUST set them in controls!):
1- Keybind that uses offhand item (Default RMB). Don't use mouse1(left click) as the custom keybind, it interferes with the entire mod (and maybe other mods too).

2- Keybind that manually swaps items in the slots (Default Q). very useful if you disable above keybind for usage of dual-attack weapons.


Configurable slot position! You can open the mod configuration page and enable the dragging option to move the slot around with your mouse, keep in mind the position is separate for inventory open/closed.

You can also apply an offset afterwards for fine tuning, enter a number and it will apply when you save. The number resets to 0 on save so you can offset as many times as you need.

Resetting position is possible by enabling the "Reset Slot Position?" option. This will also reset on save.





If you want to use weapons with 2 different attacks, keeping offhand empty will allow your hotbar weapons to utilize both buttons.
You can also rebind 'Use Offhand Item' to something other than Mouse2(RMB) to allow main hand's 2 functions to work. If you UNBIND it, you can use the 'Swap Offhand' keybind to manually swap whenever desired.
