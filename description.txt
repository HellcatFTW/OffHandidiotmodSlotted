Put an item in the custom slot below inventory, and when you use your custom keybind (Default RMB), it will use the item in that slot. 
Only allows using one at a time, no doubling your dps! (Summoners using two whips with 2 buttons.. I'm looking at you.)

MOD IS SUPER MEGA INCOMPATIBLE WITH MULTIPLAYER RIGHT NOW!!! 

Configurable keybinds! (you MUST set them in controls!):
1- Keybind that uses offhand item (Default RMB). Don't use mouse1(left click) as the custom keybind, it interferes with the entire mod (and maybe other mods too).

2- Keybind that manually swaps items in the slots (Default T, conflicts with vanilla "throw item"). very useful if you disable above keybind for usage of dual-attack weapons.


If you want to use weapons with 2 different attacks, or some other buggy items, simply unbind 'Use offhand Item` and stick to just using the 'Swap Offhand' keybind.
