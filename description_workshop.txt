[h2] What does this mod do? [/h2]
It adds a new slot below your inventory, where you can place an item that will be used when holding the mod's [b] 'Use offhand Item' [/b] keybind(RMB). It also allows manually swapping between the selected hotbar slot's item and offhand, to use it without the quick-use keybind.

Want to place blocks with one hand and hammer with the other? No problem! Maybe dig them up while placing them? That also works. Or you can use 2 different weapons!

Configurable keybinds!  [b] (you MUST set them in controls!): [/b]

1. Keybind that uses offhand item (Default RMB).  [b] Don't use Mouse1(LMB) [/b] as the custom keybind.

2. Keybind that manually swaps items from current hotbar slot to offhand and vice-versa (Default Q, since few other mods use this key): very useful if you disable above keybind for usage of dual-function items.


[b] Configurable slot position! [/b] You can open the mod configuration page and enable the dragging option to move the slot around with your mouse, keep in mind the position is separate for inventory open/closed.

You can also apply an offset afterwards for fine tuning, enter a number and it will apply when you save. The number resets to 0 on save so you can offset as many times as you need.

Resetting position can be done by using "Restore Defaults" in the mod's config page.



If you want to use weapons with 2 different attacks, keeping offhand empty will allow your hotbar weapons to utilize both buttons.

You can also rebind 'Use Offhand Item' to something other than Mouse2(RMB) to allow main hand's 2 functions to work. If you UNBIND it, you can use the 'Swap Offhand' keybind to manually swap whenever desired.

if an item doesn't work as intended or if you have any suggestions, leave a comment on the workshop or its discussion threads.

Calamity gimmick swords obviously won't work if your Mouse2(RMB) is taken up by this mod. Rebind it to something else if you want to use those.
