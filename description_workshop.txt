[h2] What does this mod do? [/h2]
It adds a new slot below your inventory, where you can place an item that will be used when holding the mod's [b] 'Use offhand Item' [/b] keybind(RMB). It also allows manually swapping between the selected hotbar slot's item and offhand, to use it without the quick-use keybind.

Want to place blocks with one hand and hammer with the other? No problem! Maybe dig them up while placing them? That also works. Or you can use 2 different weapons!

Configurable keybinds!  [b] (you MUST set them in controls!): [/b]

1. Keybind that uses offhand item (Default RMB).  [b] Don't use mouse1 (left click) [/b] as the custom keybind: it interferes with the entire mod (and maybe other mods too).

2. Keybind that manually swaps items from current hotbar slot to offhand and vice-versa (Default Q, since few other mods use this key): very useful if you disable above keybind for usage of dual-function items.


[b] Configurable slot position! [/b] You can open the mod configuration page and change the X/Y coordinates for both HUD and inventory screen.



If you want to use weapons with 2 different attacks, simply unbind 'Use offhand Item' and stick to just using the 'Swap Offhand' keybind, that way you can use those weapons like normal.

This also applies for anything that doesn't work correctly with the 'Use offhand Item' bind. I'm fixing as much of that as I can at the moment.
